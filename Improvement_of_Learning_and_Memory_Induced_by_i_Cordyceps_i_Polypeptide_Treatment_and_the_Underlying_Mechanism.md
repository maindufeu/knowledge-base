## Abstract
Our previous research revealed that Cordyceps militaris can improve the learning and memory, and although the main active ingredient should be its polypeptide complexes, the underlying mechanism of its activity remains poorly understood. ==In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which Cordyceps militaris improves learning and memory in a mouse model==. Mice were given scopolamine hydrobromide intraperitoneally to establish a mouse model of learning and memory impairment. The effects of Cordyceps polypeptide in this model were tested using the Morris water maze test; serum superoxide dismutase activity; serum malondialdehyde levels; activities of acetyl cholinesterase, Na+-k+-ATPase, and nitric oxide synthase; and gamma aminobutyric acid and glutamate contents in brain tissue. Moreover, differentially expressed genes and the related cellular signaling pathways were screened using an mRNA expression profile chip. ==The results showed that the genes Pik3r5 , Il-1 β , and Slc18a2 were involved in the effects of Cordyceps polypeptide on the nervous system of these mice==. ==Our findings suggest that Cordyceps polypeptide may improve learning and memory in the scopolamine-induced mouse model of learning and memory impairment by scavenging oxygen free radicals, preventing oxidative damage, and protecting the nervous system==.

## Summary

### Introduction
Learning and memory are among the main functions of the human brain, and together they play an important role in biological evolution and development [^1].
The drugs commonly used clinically for prevention and improvement of learning and memory impairment include free radical scavengers, drugs to prevent beta amyloidal deposits formation, M receptor agonists, and acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors.
To investigate the mechanism responsible for this effect of Cordyceps militaris on learning and memory, in the present study, we first established a mouse model of acquired learning and memory impairment via intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine hydrobromide
Using this model, we examined the effects of Cordyceps polypeptide on the learning and memory abilities of the mice by observing mouse behavior serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity; serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content; the acetyl cholinesterase AChE, Na+-k+-ATPase, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activities; and the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) contents in mouse brain tissues.
The ability of Cordyceps polypeptide to prevent and improve learning and memory impairment in the model mice was confirmed, and the data obtained for the related mechanisms may provide an important theoretical basis for the further research and development of Cordyceps polypeptide

### Animals
A total of 120 eight-week-old male ICR mice, weighing 18~22 g, were purchased from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (license number: SCXK (Liao)-2015-0001).
A total of 120 eight-week-old male ICR mice, weighing 18~22 g, were purchased from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
The mice were housed individually in an environment of controlled temperature (20 ± 1°C) and humidity (40–70%) and subjected to 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.
The study was conducted according to the European Community Guidelines for the Use of Experimental Animals, and the Ethics Committee of Beihua University approved the study protocol

### Animal Experiments
An appropriate amount of the dried fruiting body of Cordyceps militaris was ground into powders (40 mesh).
The powder was defatted with petroleum ether and the residue was dried.
50 g of the dried residue was dissolved in 450 mL distilled water and the solution was adjusted to pH 2.0 with 1 M HCl. 10 g pepsin was added to the solution at 37°C for enzymolysis for 5 h.
The solution was heated at 100°C in a water bath for 10 min for inactivation of the pepsin.
It was filtered and subjected to centrifugation for collection of the supernatant and was lyophilized to obtain a Cordyceps polypeptide powder (5.36 g)

### Animal Grouping and Administration
One hundred twenty mice were randomly divided into six groups according to treatment: a blank control group, the model group, a positive control group, a high-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group (900 mg·kg−1), a middle-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group (450 mg·kg−1), and a low-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group (225 mg·kg−1).
Mice in the positive control group were given the positive control drug Piracetam Tablets at a dose of 600 mg·kg−1, and mice in the blank control and model groups received the same volume of distilled water intragastrically once daily for 45 consecutive days

### Animal Model Preparation and Animal Training
Prior to the behavioral testing, the mice were placed in the water maze apparatus and allowed to swim freely for 2 min on 2 consecutive days, for adaptation of the mice to the environment.
One week before the intragastric administration of drug, the water maze test began.
At 1 h after the intragastric administration, the mice in the blank control group were given an intraperitoneal injection of saline (3 mL·kg−1) and mice in the other groups received an intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine hydrobromide (3 mg·kg−1) for the establishment of an acquired mouse learning and memory impairment model, and 15 min later the Morris water maze test was carried out for 7 consecutive days

### Morris Water Maze Test
The Morris water maze apparatus consisted of two parts, a cylindrical tube and recording device.
The mice were placed into the water facing the pool wall in any two quadrants except the quadrant containing the platform.
Escape latencies within 120 s were recorded and average escape latency values were calculated as the evaluation indexes.
On day 7, the spatial search test was carried out.
For this text, the platform was removed, and the mice were placed into the water in a fixed quadrant, facing the wall of the pool.
The number of errors made by the mice while crossing the place where the platform had been within 120 s was recorded, and the average values were calculated as the evaluation indexes

### Animal Sampling and Biochemical Index Detection Method
Following the Morris water maze test, the eyeballs of the mice were removed with clean forceps for the collection of 1 mL of whole blood.
The blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 r/min at 4°C for 10 min to obtain the serum, and the serum samples were stored at −20°C until use.
The whole brain tissues of mice were harvested, weighed, and prepared into a 10% homogenate upon addition of saline at a ratio of 1 : 9 (w : v) in an ice water bath.
The homogenate was centrifuged at 3500 r/min at 4°C for 10 min to obtain the supernatant, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C until use.
In accordance with the instructions for the detection kits, the serum SOD activity and MDA content were measured, the AChE, Na+-k+-ATP, and eNOS activities were assessed, and the GABA and Glu contents in the brain tissues were determined according to the instructions for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits

### RNA Extraction and Quality Control
The total liver RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) by following the operating instructions.
The liver tissue-Trizol homogenate was drawn strongly several times with a 5 mL disposable syringe until the homogenate was no longer sticky, in order to fully break down the cells and genomic DNA, which was kept at room temperature for use.
Chloroform was added to the homogenate in a ratio of 200 μL chloroform per 1 mL Trizol used, which was strongly oscillated for 30 s to be mixed evenly, kept at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min to obtain the supernatant.
The residue-ethanol solution was centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was thrown away, and the residue was dried at room temperature.
The total RNA mass was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and the mRNA was purified in accordance with the instructions of RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
The same amount of RNA taken from each mouse in each group was mixed and used for the chip detection

### Sample Labeling and Hybridization
Before RNA labeling, the Agilent ND-1000 was used to detect RNA degradation and determine RNA concentration.
Samples were labeled with the Agilent Quick Amp Labeling kit and hybridized with Agilent SureHyb. Sample labeling and array hybridization were performed according to the Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis protocol (Agilent Technology).
Total RNA from each sample was linearly amplified and labeled with Cy3-UTP.
The labeled cRNAs were purified by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
The concentration and specific activity of the labeled cRNAs were measured by NanoDrop ND-1000.
100 μL of hybridization solution was dispensed into the gasket slide and assembled to the gene expression microarray slide.
The slides were incubated for 17 hours at 65°C in an Agilent Hybridization Oven.
The hybridized arrays were washed, fixed, and scanned using the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner

### Data Acquisition and Standardization
The chip was scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner. The Agilent Feature Extraction software (v11.0.0.1) was used to acquire chip probe signal values, and the Agilent Gene Spring GX v12.1 software was used for standardization of the chip results.
Points located outside of the 95% confidence interval represented differentially expressed genes

### Significance Analysis of the Functions of Differentially Expressed Genes
Gene ontology (GO) annotation of the differentially expressed genes was performed using the NCBI Gene Ontology database to identify all the GO categories in which the genes were involved, and Fisher exact test and the X2 test were applied to calculate the significance level and error rate for each GO.
The error rate was used to calibrate the P values, screening out the significant GO categories reflected by the differentially expressed genes (P < 0.05) [^19].
The complete genome of the mouse was selected as including the background genes, and the “Functional Annotation Tool” was applied as the analysis tool, so that the results of the GO enrichment analysis and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes could be obtained [^21].

### Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc.).
The single factor analysis of variance and q test of the measurement data were performed with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) program, and least squared differences were used for the pairwise comparison.
The ranked data were analyzed by Rid it.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant [^23]

### Effects of Cordyceps Polypeptide on Behavior of Mice with Learning and Memory Impairment
In the positioning navigation test on days 1–6, the escape latency during the first 3 days did not differ among mice in the different groups, but on days 4–6, the escape latency of mice in the model group was significantly prolonged compared with that of mice in the control group (P < 0.01), indicating that the model was successfully established.
On days 4 and 5, the escape latencies of mice in both the high-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group and the positive drug group were significantly shortened compared with that of mice in the model group (P < 0.05).
By day 6, the escape latencies of mice in all Cordyceps polypeptide-treated groups and the positive drug group were significantly shortened compared with that of mice in the model group (P < 0.05).
In the spatial search test on day 7, the number of times that the mice crossed the platform in the model group was significantly less than that in the control group (P < 0.05), whereas the numbers of platform crossings in the high-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group and the positive drug group were significantly greater than that in the control group (P < 0.05; Table 2)

### Effects of Cordyceps Polypeptide on the Serum SOD Activity and MDA Content
Compared with those in the blank control group, the serum SOD activity in the serum of mice was significantly reduced and the MDA content was significantly increased in mice of the model group (P < 0.05), further confirming that the model was successfully established.
Compared with those in the model group, the serum SOD activity was significantly increased, and the MDA content was significantly reduced in the high-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group and the positive control group (P < 0.05; Table 3).
Effects of Cordyceps polypeptide on the serum SOD activity and MDA content in mice

### Effects of Cordyceps
Polypeptide on AChE, Na+-k+-ATPase, and eNOS Activities and GABA and Glu Contents in the Brain Tissue of Mice.
The AChE activity was significantly higher (P < 0.05), the Na+-k+-ATPase and eNOS activities were significantly lower (P < 0.05), and the GABA and Glu contents were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the brain tissue of mice in the model group compared with those in the blank control group, confirming that the model was successfully established
Compared with those in the model group, the AChE activities were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the Na+-k+-ATPase and eNOS activities were significantly increased, and GABA and Glu contents were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the brain tissue of mice in the high-dose Cordyceps polypeptide group and the positive control group.
The differences in the mRNA chip results were significant between the Cordyceps polypeptide-treated group and the model group, and the results showed that Cordyceps polypeptide could significantly inhibit the expression level of genes related to the nervous system

### Clustering Results
The GO cluster analysis of the 450 differentially expressed genes was carried out using the DAVID database, and 36 related pathways were found.
Seven of these pathways were directly related to the immune function.
Statistical analysis for the genes related to these seven pathways showed that multiple genes were involved in more than one of the seven pathways, and further analysis revealed that the pathways involving three genes (PIK3R5, IL-1B, and SLC18A2) were the most (Table 5)

### Real-Time Quantitative PCR Verification
Real-time quantitative PCR validation of the expression of three genes, including Pik3r5, Il-1β, and Slc18a2, was conducted.
The Pik3r5 and Il-1β expression levels were found to be significantly altered in the brain tissue of mice in the model group (P = 0.015997, P = 0.001177) with expression ratios of 0.8 and 0.12, respectively, between the Cordyceps polypeptide-treated group and model group (Figure 2), and this resulted in negative regulation on immune activity.
The Slc18a2 gene was significantly upregulated in the brain tissue of mice with learning and memory impairment (P = 0.002095 with an expression ratio of 1.79 between the Cordyceps polypeptide-treated group and model group)

### Discussions
With increases in the social pressure and the incidence of various diseases, more and more people, including the elderly and teens, have begun to experience the symptoms of a decline in memory.
The real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of Pik3r5, Il-1β, and Slc18a2 further indicated that these three genes were all the key factors in the effects of Cordyceps polypeptide on the nervous system in the mouse model of learning and memory impairment.
Our mRNA chip analysis in this study confirms that Cordyceps polypeptide can inhibit the expression of a gene, which may be advantageous for the regeneration of neurons and play a protective role in the nervous system, whereby Cordyceps polypeptide may improve the mice's learning and memory of mice [^28].
Cordyceps polypeptide treatment could promote the expression of Slc18a2 and thereby promoted the secretion of neurotransmitters in mice to reduce dyskinesia and depression-like behavior, which may be conducive to the improvement of learning and memory.
The downregulation expression in mRNA chip indicates that Cordyceps polypeptide may inhibit the expression of the gene, which can be used as a potential drug target of Cordyceps militaris for the further experiment research

### Conclusions
A mouse model of learning and memory impairment was established via injection of scopolamine hydrobromide and the effects of different doses of Cordyceps polypeptide delivered intragastrically were investigated by the evaluation of mouse behavior via Morris water maze testing, the measurement of several biological indexes in the serum and brain tissue of the mice, and the identification of differentially expressed genes and the related cellular signaling pathways.
The results showed that Cordyceps polypeptide could improve the learning and memory in these mice, increase the serum SOD activity, decrease the serum MDA content, reduce AChE activity, increase Na+-k+-ATPase and eNOS activity, and increase GABA and Glu levels in the brain tissue of the mice.
The mRNA expression file chip analysis, clustering analysis of the gene function according to the DAVID database, and real-time qPCR verification indicate that the improvement in learning and memory induced by Cordyceps polypeptide treatment in the mouse model of learning and memory impairments is likely related to its effects on Pik3r5, Il-1β, and Slc18a2, and these three genes may be the potential targets for Cordyceps militaris
