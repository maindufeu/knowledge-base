## Abstract
and Figures
==This paper presents a novel knowledge representation framework for smart city planning and management that enables the semantic integration of heterogeneous urban data from diverse sources==. Currently, the combination of information across city agencies is cumbersome, as the increasingly available datasets are stored in disparate data silos, using different models and schemas for their description. To overcome this interoperability barrier, the presented framework employs a modular and scalable system architecture, comprising a comprehensive ontology capable of integrating data from various sectors within a city, a web ontology browser, and a web-based knowledge graph for online data discovery, mapping, and sharing across stakeholders. Linked Data, Semantic Web technologies, and ontology matching techniques are key to the framework's implementation. The paper ultimately showcases an application example, where the framework is used as a semantic enrichment mechanism in a platform for urban analytics, focusing particularly on human-generated data integration.

## Summary
This paper presents a novel knowledge representation framework for smart city planning and management that enables the semantic integration of heterogeneous urban data from diverse sources.
To enrich urban digital twins and better understand city evolution, the integration of heterogeneous, spatio-temporal data has become a large area of research in the enrichment of 3D and 4D (3D + Time) semantic city models.
These models, which can represent the 3D geospatial data of a city and their evolving semantic relations, may require data-driven integration approaches to provide temporal and concurrent views of the urban landscape.
This paper proposes a model-centric ontology-based data integration approach towards limiting semantic data loss in 4D semantic urban data transformations to semantic graph formats.
There is need for an approach to support system alignment and data integration between different technologies to enable the seamless transfer of data across different stakeholders involved in providing digital services in smart cities (Psyllidis, 2015).
This study adds to the body of knowledge by adopting a EA in an urban context to aid in the digital transformation of cities in addressing to support alignment and integration among different components operating in a city allowing stakeholders to collaborate in exchanging data via different systems for sharing resources and providing seamless digital services.
Design/methodology/approach-Qualitative method is applied to evaluate the presented architecture based on electric-mobility (e-Mobility) scenario and data was collected using case study via interviews from a municipality in Norway to validate the applicability of EA for digital transformation of city services.
Developing smart city applications typically faces challenges such as meeting several complex requirements, integrating heterogeneous data sources, and considering geographical information representing the real-world urban space.
Despite the existence of many platforms to support the development of smart city applications, most of them do not associate the offered services with geographical information, do not support performing semantic queries on the available data, and have limitations that may burden development tasks.
A very large number of public and private data sets are available around the local governments
In most cases, they are not semantically interoperable and a huge human effort is needed to create integrated ontologies and knowledge base for smart city.


## Study subjects

### 300 papers
- This paper describes a systematic review's results that aimed to verify the state of the art about potential consumer profiles of linked and open data in smart cities. ==An initial screening of 300 papers was carried out, which underwent a criteria's selection aiming to identify the papers that deal with the application of open data and linked data in any domain of smart cities or that carry out a more theoretical evaluation of the subject matter involving end-users in smart cities==. As a result, it was noticed that the semantic web studies are still concerned with technical issues, but that there are already researchers concerned with Computer-Human Interaction perspectives for data access that profiles of citizens present in smart cities
